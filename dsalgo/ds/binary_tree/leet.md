- In a **binary tree**, each node has one parent and each parent node can point to atmost one node
- A binary tree is said to be **full** if each points to zero or two nodes
- A binary tree is said to be **perfect** if all nodes except last **level** have two child nodes
- For perfect binary tree if theare are N levels, then there are 2^N - 1 nodes
- A **binary search tree**(divide & conquer) is special binary tree where each node's left child is less than  or equal its current value and right child is greater than curr value
